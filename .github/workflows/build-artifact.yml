    # Available Options:
    #   warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
    #   error: Fail the action with an error message
    #   ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

        # # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
        # # Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.
    
        # retention-days: # optional
        # # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.
    
        # compression-level: # optional, default is 6
        # # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.
    
        # overwrite: # optional, default is false
